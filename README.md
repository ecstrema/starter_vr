# Starter VR

This is a template for a VR project using [three.js](https://threejs.org/), [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [eslint](https://eslint.org/).

It has compression support, an automated github pages deployment workflow and eslint is setup.

It lets you quickly get started with a VR project using the [WebXR Device API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API).

pnpm install
pnpm dev
